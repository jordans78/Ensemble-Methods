Introduction

This paper considers the problems associated with prediction of customs revenues by
ministries of finance and customs administrations. Accurate predictions of customs
revenues result in better liquidity of the central budget, and for that reason, they are
extremely important for successful management of public finances. The orthodox
approach to forecasting revenues is usually based on forecasting revenues based on
tax buoyancy and tax elasticity, with respect of some economic proxy. However, this
approach has some shortcomings which can negatively affect accuracy, and for that
reason we examine different approaches (machine learning and ensembling). Namely,
nowadays in the era of Big Data and digitisation in customs, new approaches based
on computer algorithms can give us better results as compared to classic modelling.
The paper concludes that using ensemble methods that combine different types of
heterogeneous models such as statistical modelling and machine learning can improve
forecast accuracy when predicting customs revenues.

Even though customs revenues are collected by customs administrations within customs procedures,
forecasting the collection of such revenues is ordinarily performed by ministries of finance.
Nevertheless, ministries also need predictions performed by customs administrations themselves. In
this regard, we shall review the most frequently used approaches when planning the revenues.
The orthodox approach to forecasting tax revenues (including customs revenues) is usually based
on forecasting revenues based on tax buoyancy and tax elasticity. Tax buoyancy measures the gross
elasticity of tax revenues in relation to the respective macroeconomic variable (for instance, import
or consumption). The main characteristic of this approach is that it measures the overall elasticity of
taxes in relation to their base. In the tax elasticity approach, the time series needs to be first excluded
from the discretionary measures of the fiscal policy to calculate the coefficient of the net tax elasticity
in relation to the respective macroeconomic variable. Tax elasticity, according to Jenkins et al.
(2000, p. 39), is a relevant factor for forecasting and is most often used by ministries of finance when
forecasting tax revenues. Furthermore, to obtain more robust forecasts when estimating the elasticities,
it is necessary to harmonise them with the business cycle in the economy, which has significant effects
on revenue collection. The advantage of such forecasting is that the forecasted revenues are fully
correlated with the macroeconomic indicators so that, should they increase, the revenues are expected
to correlate with such an increase. However, this forecasting approach also has its shortcomings.
